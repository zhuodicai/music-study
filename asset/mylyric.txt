Hush my spiffing lovie, don't you cry
We are going to a summer bonfire
Oh the summer of millennium
I can not wait to dance with you
This just can not be summer love, you will see
The summer of millennium
We know it is nearly over
Feels like July mist
Oh that summer bonfire
Yeah the summer of millennium
